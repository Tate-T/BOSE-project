                        <p class="fine">Firstly, make sure your headphones are turned on with a single press of the top
                            button on the back of the right earbud. Then press and hold the power button for 3 seconds
                            to put the headphones into pairing mode. Please note that if you connect the headphones for
                            the first time, they will automatically turn on immediately in this pairing mode. Voice
                            prompts will provide you with additional instructions. We recommend that you use the Bose
                            Music app to complete the pairing process, however you can also use the Bluetooth settings
                            on your device.</p>
